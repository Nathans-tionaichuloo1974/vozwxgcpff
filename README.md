Okay, just walked out of The Electric State and I'm still trying to piece together what just... went down. The theater chairs were like sitting on slightly cushioned bricks and my back's really letting me know about that now... anyway, the film! So wild. Like, you're dropped into this world with a bang and whoosh, you're riding shotgun with a girl and her robot like, out of nowhere. You get this sense of old Hollywood meets cybertronic wasteland. Like if Blade Runner and a Western had a baby that was raised by Studio Ghibli. 

Popcorn still in my teeth, think I almost choked when, you know, that big explosion happened and woah, really felt the rumble. It was like the movie reached out and slugged you right in the gut. And, man, the score! It's like a hypnotic symphony — like Pan’s Labyrinth started playing guitar instead of violin.

The story's this blend of epic quest and personal soul trip, thick with nostalgia but glazed with future weirdness. There’s this constant weave between utter silence and a chaotic orchestra like digging through an old garage for hidden tech gems... really vibed with me. Oh and hey, who's the lead actress? She's just magnetic, like she could read the phone book and I'd still be there, glued.

> This kid next to me kept whispering, Wow! every few minutes. It kind of added to the whole thing — like soundtracked gasps from a tiny audience member.

Wasn't there a movie someone wanted me to download recently? I dunno, feels like something Evans or Wright directed? But The Electric State just shouts Chris Pratt in a way that says, Hey, I’m here to surprise you! Also, gotta remember to tell Maxine not to forget to watch the movie — she’s gonna love the landscapes, pure digital art posing as reality.

There's a glitchy feel, you know, like when you play a retro game and it suddenly loads too fast — characters blinking in and out of existence. That avant-garde clashing with the heart of a buddy road trip is something I'm still processing. 

Yeah, it's chaotic. But what else did I expect? I mean, my thoughts are racing along with that car on the screen, almost missed it but it's about loss and the whole search for connection and identity — or maybe I'm just trying to sound philosophical.
